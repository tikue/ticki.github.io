      <description>Half a year ago, I designed Eudex as a modern replacement for Soundex, which is still widely used today. Eudex supports a wide range of special-cases of European languages, while preserving the spirit of simplicity, Soundex has.
Both Eudex and Soundex are phonetic algorithms that produce a representation of the sound of some string. Eudex is fundamentally different from Soundex in that it is not a phonetic classifier. It is a phonetic locality-sensitive hash, which means that two similarly-sounding strings are not mapped to the same value, but instead to values near to each other.</description>
